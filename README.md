# build it
ng build [-c dev]

# Run dev server
ng serve [-c dev]

## âœ… Open points

- Better SASS structure and cleanup
- Cleanup of .whatever configurations (Prettier, ESLint, etc.)
- Add user interactions for layer control
- Caddy based Docker image
- GitHub CI pipeline (docker build, tag, publish?)
- Make Docker image configurable at runtime
- Make Caddy proxy requests to tile server
- Pin package.json versions
